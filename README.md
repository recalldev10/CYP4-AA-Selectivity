# CYP RSMF Analysis

This program investigates the selectivity and stability of four Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP4F11, CYP4F2, CYP4F3A, CYP4F3B) in converting arachidonic acid (AA) into 20-HETE, a metabolite with significant physiological effects. The analysis assesses how computational models compare with existing experimental results.

My specific CYP isomer was CYP4F3B

## Description

The goal of this project is to determine the effectiveness and selectivity of four different CYP enzymes in converting AA into 20-HETE, particularly focusing on stability analysis, ligand contacts, and structural flexibility. Computational modeling techniques, including RMSF analysis and ligand contact identification, were used to predict enzyme behavior and selectivity. The project was conducted using various computational biology tools and methods under the guidance of Dr. David Koes.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python (version X.X or higher)
* Bioinformatics libraries: RDKit, PyMOL, AMBER
